Web3 Basics – Hands-On Assignment

This repository contains the complete submission for the Web3 Basics Hands-On Assignment, which focuses on gaining practical experience with blockchain technology, Web3 concepts, crypto wallets, test networks, and decentralized applications (DApps).

The assignment was completed entirely in a risk-free testnet environment, with an emphasis on understanding real user interactions with the blockchain rather than writing smart contract code.

🛠️ Tools Used

MetaMask
Browser-based cryptocurrency wallet used to create and manage the wallet, securely store keys, connect to the Ethereum test network, and sign blockchain transactions.

Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
Ethereum test network used to perform blockchain interactions safely without using real cryptocurrency.

Sepolia Faucet
Used to obtain free testnet ETH required to execute transactions and interact with decentralized applications on the Sepolia network.

Uniswap (Testnet Version)
Decentralized application (DApp) used to perform an on-chain token swap and understand wallet-to-DApp interaction, transaction approval, and gas fee handling.

Etherscan (Sepolia)
Blockchain explorer used to verify transactions, view transaction hashes, check confirmation status, inspect gas fees, and analyze transaction details on the Sepolia network.

🔍 Project Highlights

Successfully created and secured a crypto wallet following best security practices.

Configured and used an Ethereum test network (Sepolia).

Acquired and verified testnet ETH using a public faucet.

Connected a wallet to a decentralized application and executed an on-chain transaction.

Verified all transactions using a public block explorer.

Gained hands-on understanding of wallet security, gas fees, transaction lifecycle, and blockchain transparency.

🔐 Security & Compliance Notes

All interactions were performed only on testnet.

No real cryptocurrency was used.

No private keys, seed phrases, or sensitive wallet information are included in this repository.

Only public information such as testnet wallet address and transaction hashes (for verification) were documented in the report.
